// injector_ESP32_state_machine.ino

/* sketch to control motorized injection machine via ESP32 for direct Nema34 160mm with external DM860H
driver, 3 inductive endstops, 3 lower keypad buttons with Neopixel LEDs behind them to indicate distinct
funtionality, SPI thermocouple, & independant Encoder to Motor comparison, all via a State Machine to 
progress thru different machine states, using either sensor or user input via buttons

sketch should return via Serial data on Encoder and Temp, later this ESP32 will be connected via UART to 
a ESP32 Display, which will hold different mould structs, and therefore be able to load to the motor ESP32
distinct injection parameters as per mould to inject, and also keep track from Encoder data of when the 
injector is Refilled, so each Refill will be graphically represented by a rectangule inside a tube like 
graphic, move down and change color as injection and refills happens, & have a timing tracker to be able 
to see if it has had enough time to melt (avoiding cold injections!) */




/* global varible definitions & declaractions, some may be moved to local funtions, but 
leave here and comment out where they have gone - QUESTION: can LOCAL variables within functions be changed via 
serial message updates..? ex: compressionFunction has local speedReductionFactor & comparisonPercentage, during 
initial sketch & machine calibration, it may be necessary to update these values, would be easier via Serial
than flashing...? Although in theory, once checked and sure cannot cause infinite loop, should again be purely 
local and never need changing

  /* notes on MachineState...:
1) "return" in called functions will return back to this function EACH LOOP..? or ONLY when a user input 
finishes the called function..? This would cause a jump to next state..?  
1a) or the CASE statement should provide the user input to pass to the next state 

example, Purge State the user  may press the down/up buton varios times, but until presses Confirm, 
the State is the same and will not change 

to revise, that each State has an exit code line that must be completed (by user or parameter value
of sensor) before being able to change State


2) variables (passed on to called functions) that can be adjusted by user input must be global, but 
variables that will never change (except by re-writing code as are fundamentally incorrect) should 
be only declared within the FUNCTION that is later called from this general function,... example, 
ProgrammedMotorMove is called many times, with distStepsint variable values as per State of machine, so 
will require global variables, but HomeMove will ALWAYS use same (common) variables, so should be
declared within this function locally...
some States will requiere Actual values particular to this cycle, other States maybe Common values that
should never change..? However, it would be good practice to have Common variables also globals as 
SOMETIMES there may be a requirement to change them especially during testing and calibration, 
these local variables may be more convenient to have as globals, and write extra functions to 
be able to change them..? Once running alpha machine, should be able to distStepsiguish more variables
that can be made local to functions, and others that, although Common, may require occasional 
adjustment.. QUESTION: can local varibles of a function be updated via Serial writes..? Useful...
