// injector_ESP32_state_machine.ino

/* sketch to control motorized injection machine via ESP32 for direct Nema34 160mm with external DM860H
driver, 3 inductive endstops, 3 lower keypad buttons with Neopixel LEDs behind them to indicate distinct
funtionality, SPI thermocouple, & independant Encoder to Motor comparison, all via a State Machine to 
progress thru different machine states, using either sensor or user input via buttons

sketch should return via Serial data on Encoder and Temp, later this ESP32 will be connected via UART to 
a ESP32 Display, which will hold different mould structs, and therefore be able to load to the motor ESP32
distinct injection parameters as per mould to inject, and also keep track from Encoder data of when the 
injector is Refilled, so each Refill will be graphically represented by a rectangule inside a tube like 
graphic, move down and change color as injection and refills happens, & have a timing tracker to be able 
to see if it has had enough time to melt (avoiding cold injections!) */




/* global varible definitions & declaractions, some may be moved to local funtions, but 
leave here and comment out where they have gone - QUESTION: can LOCAL variables within functions be changed via 
serial message updates..? ex: compressionFunction has local speedReductionFactor & comparisonPercentage, during 
initial sketch & machine calibration, it may be necessary to update these values, would be easier via Serial
than flashing...? Although in theory, once checked and sure cannot cause infinite loop, should again be purely 
local and never need changing
